A TODO web-app header should typically include the following elements:

Logo or Application Name: Displaying the logo or name of your web application at the top left corner can help users quickly identify the application they are using.

Navigation Menu: Include links or buttons for navigating to different sections of the application, such as Home, My Tasks, Completed Tasks, Settings, etc.

Search Bar (Optional): If your TODO app supports searching for tasks, you can include a search bar in the header to allow users to quickly find specific tasks.

User Profile Menu: If your application requires user authentication, include a menu or dropdown for accessing user profile settings, account information, and options for signing out.

Add Task Button: Provide a prominent button for adding new tasks. This button should be easily accessible and visible to users, encouraging them to quickly add new tasks as needed.

Notifications (Optional): If your TODO app supports notifications for task reminders or updates, you can include a notification icon or bell icon in the header to alert users of any new notifications.

Theme Switcher (Optional): If your application supports different themes or color schemes, include an option in the header for users to switch between themes based on their preferences.

Help or Support Link: Provide a link or button in the header for accessing help documentation, FAQs, or support resources to assist users in using the application effectively.

Feedback or Contact Us Link: Include a link or button for users to provide feedback or contact support if they encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving the application.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the header is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across various platforms.

By incorporating these elements into the header of your TODO web-app, you can create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that enhances the user experience and improves usability.
